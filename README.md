# ðŸ’» Things I tried to code while watching Numberphile YouTube videos 

+ ### [Left-truncatable primes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azL5ehbw_24)
 Code tries to find all truncatable primes in base 10 (there are 4260 of them). I firstly tried to check for primality by iterating up to square root of number but it was running too slow. Then I used Rabin-Miller test which worked so much faster.

+ ### [Witness numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MscGSN5J6o)
Program that uses square-and-multiply algorithm and checks using Rabin-Miller test how many strong liars each number has and then scores each number for how often it shows up as a liar.
